# Image Server
### Made by Luis Pavel

## Description
With this server you can upload, delete, view, download your images!

It has two themes, dark mode and light mode.

Only the person with the token will be able to upload or delete the images.

The tokens are encrypted and are stored in the Environment Variables.

This is my submission for the #MadeWithReplit hackathon! I hope you like it!

## Self Hosting
You can self host this by forking this repl and running it to install all of the packages. Then run `node setup.js` in the shell. Follow the steps to set up the server.

I am not responsable for any misuses of this server. Do not use it to host any malicious images.
